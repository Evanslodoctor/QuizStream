### **Online Examination System**

**Description:** This Django-based web application facilitates online exams for educational institutions. The system supports exam management by administrators, student logins, exam-taking, and real-time feedback.

- **Technologies Used:** Django, Python, HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- **Key Features:**
  - User registration and login for both students and administrators
  - Admin can create, update, and manage exam questions
  - Students can take exams and receive results
  - Contact Us page for user inquiries
  - Real-time exam progress and result calculation

**Instructions**

- Install the Requirements: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
- Then, make database migrations:
```bash
  python manage.py makemigrations
  python manage.py migrate
```
- And finally, run the application
```bash
  python manage.py runserver
```

# Admin Account Setup

To set up an admin account for the Django application, follow these steps:

1. **Create a Superuser Account**

   Open your terminal or command prompt and navigate to your project directory. Run the following command to create a superuser:

```bash
   python manage.py createsuperuser
```
# Follow the Prompts for Superuser Creation

When creating a superuser account for Django, you will be prompted to enter specific details. Follow these instructions:

1. **Username**
   - Enter a desired username for the superuser account. This will be used for logging into the Django admin panel.

2. **Email Address**
   - Provide a valid email address. This is optional but recommended for receiving notifications and password recovery.

3. **Password**
   - Enter a secure password for the superuser account. Make sure to choose a strong password that includes a mix of letters, numbers, and special characters.

4. **Confirm Password**
   - Re-enter the password to confirm it. Ensure that both entries match exactly.

5. **Confirmation Messages**
   - Django will display confirmation messages if the provided information is valid. If there are any issues (e.g., password strength or username conflicts), Django will prompt you to correct them.

Once you complete these steps, the superuser account will be created and you can use these credentials to log in to the Django admin panel.
